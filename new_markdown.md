# New markdown file
## Things I learned
- There's something called a profile README, I hadn't heard of that
- how to make files through the online GitHub interphase, I mainly just use git to have a versions of my own code :computer:

## Things I'm still confused about 
- The difference between *creating a branch* of a repo and *creating a fork* of a repo. 

## Bonus section
